<h2>AG2015-01: Potential Authenticated User Spoofing in zf-oauth2</h2>

<p>
    We discovered a potential issue in the Web-Server Application scenario (also termed "Authorization Code") of
    <a href="https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-oauth2">zf-oauth2</a>. An attacker 
    can pass a <code>user_id</code> value in the query string when using the 
    scenario, and associate the authorization code and the token to a 
    different user. Passing the <code>user_id</code> in the query string is a bad practice; the 
    user identity should be managed server side using a value from original authorization
    (e.g. from the original login page). 
</p>

<p>
    The vulnerability exists in all stable versions of zf-oauth2 from 1.1.0 forward. Only applications
    using the <code>authorization_code</code> scenario are affected.
</p>

<h3>Action Taken</h3>

<p>
    We removed the ability to specify the <code>user_id</code> in the query 
    string when utilizing the <code>/authorize</code> resource, and we now use 
    <code>Zend\Authorization\AuthorizationService</code> as the default 
    mechanism for managing the identity of the user under this OAuth2 scenario.
</p>

<p>
    The patch fixing the issues has been applied in the following versions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>zf-oauth2 1.2.1</kbd>
    <li>zf-oauth2 1.3.1</kbd>
</ul>

<p>
    Additionally, we have released corresponding versions of the Apigility skeleton, used
    by our installer, to ensure they use these versions of zf-oauth2 by default.
</p>


<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>
    If you are using <code>zf-oauth2</code> with the web application/authorization code scenario,
    we recommend upgrading zf-oauth2 to either 1.2.1 or 1.3.1. This can usually be done using
    <code>composer update zfcampus/zf-oauth2</code>.
</ul>
