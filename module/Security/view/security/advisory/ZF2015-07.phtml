<h2>ZF2015-07: Filesystem Permissions Issues in Multiple Components</h2>

<p>
    <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/2015/08/31/security_misconfiguration_vulnerability_in_various_doctrine_projects.html">
    As reported by the Doctrine Project</a>, incorrect permissions masks when
    creating a new directory or file can lead to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Local arbitrary code execution</li>
    <li>Privilege escalation</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Such attacks typically require direct access to a user of the system to
    exploit, but are dangerous vectors when available.
</p>

<p>
    During an audit of the Zend Framework code base, we found several instances
    where we were using incorrect permissions masks that could lead to such
    vulnerabilities.
</p>

<h3>Action Taken</h3>

<p>
    We identified the following projects/components with vulnerabilities by checking
    for <code>mkdir()</code> and <code>umask()</code> calls:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Zend Framework 2's <code>zend-cache</code> component, specifically the Filesystem storage adapter and CaptureCache pattern.</li>
    <li>The admin-facing code for <a href="https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-doctrine">zf-apigility-doctrine</a></li>
    <li>Zend Framework 1's <code>Zend_Cloud</code> Filesystem storage adapter,
        <code>Zend_Search_Lucene</code>'s filesystem storage, and
        <code>Zend_Service_WindowsAzure</code>'s package scaffolder.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We updated the code as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Default privileges for creating directories were set to <code>0775</code>, and files to <code>0664</code>.</li>
    <li>If code allows specifying the permissions mask, we mask it using <code>&amp; ~0002</code>. This means that if
        you absolutely must allow world-executable privileges, you <strong>must</strong> extend the class. This leaves
        the framework secure by default, and is an effort to prevent developers from shooting themselves in the foot.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The following components/libraries were patched, at the version specified:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
    <li>Zend Framework 1, version 1.12.16</li>
    <li>Zend Framework 2, versions 2.4.8</li>
    <li>zf-apigility-doctrine, version 1.0.3</li>
    <li>zend-cache, versions 2.4.8 and 2.5.3</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This vulnerability was originally disclosed via the Doctrine project as <a 
        href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5723">CVE-2015-5723</a>.
</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>
    If you use any of the components listed above, we recommend upgrading to one
    of these versions immediately.
</p>

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>
    The Zend Framework team thanks the following for identifying the issues and 
    working with us to help protect its users:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Ocramius">Marco Pivetta</a> for notifying us of the Doctrine project's vulnerability,
        suggesting we audit similarly, and reviewing the patch;</li>
    <li><a href="https://mwop.net/">Matthew Weier O'Phinney</a> for developing the patch.</li>
</ul>
