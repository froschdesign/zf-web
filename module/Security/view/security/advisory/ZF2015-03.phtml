<h2>ZF2015-03: Invalid CSRF validation of null or incorrectly formatted token identifiers</h2>

<p>
    <kbd>Zend\Validator\Csrf</kbd>, starting in the Zend Framework 2.3 series,
    was not correctly identifying null or mal-formatted token identifiers, 
    leading to false positive validations, and thus potentially allowing for
    Cross-Site Request Forgery vectors.
</p>

<h3>Action Taken</h3>

<p>
    A patch was written that correctly identifies invalid token identifiers,
    ensuring that they invalidate the provided value.
</p>

<p>
    The patch fixing the issue has been applied in the following versions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Zend Framework 2.3.6</kbd>
</ul>

<p>
    Note: in testing the patch, we discovered that the vulnerability was introduced
    specifically in the 2.3 series, and thus no patch was necessary against the 2.2
    series.
</p>

<p>
    This vulnerability has also been disclosed as <a 
        href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1786">CVE-2015-1786</a>.
</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>
    If you are using <kbd>Zend\Validator\Csrf</kbd> (either standalone, or 
    within <kbd>Zend\InputFilter</kbd> or via <kbd>Zend\Form\Element\Csrf</kbd>)
    in the 2.3 series of Zend Framework, we recommend upgrading immediately.
</p>
